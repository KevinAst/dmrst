# Auth

This section describes the internals of **visualize-it**'s
authentication and authorization.

You are not required to sign-in to **visualize-it**.  You can build
**visualize-it** packages and run systems from file-based resources.

For "system participation" _(running a system)_ however, you must at
minimum (when not signed-in) supply a "Guest Name" (that identifies
you to other participants).

To get the full benefit of **visualize-it**, you must establish a free
account.  This allows you to perform more advanced features, like
publishing and promoting packages that you build in the cloud.

## Authentication & Authorization

[Authentication vs Authorization - What's the Difference?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/whats-the-difference-between-authentication-and-authorisation/)

- **Authentication** confirms that users are who they say they are.
- **Authorization** gives those users permission to access a resource (i.e. enablement).
